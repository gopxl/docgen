# Directory structure

For docgen to properly organize and render your documentation, you should
follow the following directory and file structure:

- `docs/` (documentation root)
  - `01. First Section/` (directory)
    - `01. First Page.md`
    - `02. Second Page.md`
  - `02. Second Section/` (directory)
    - `01. First Page.md`
    - `02. Second Page.md`

At the root level of your documentation directory, each directory represents a section
of your documentation. Inside each section directory, you can place Markdown files
corresponding to individual pages.

> [!NOTE] Markdown files that are not placed directly within a section directory will
> not appear in the navigation menu, though they can still be linked from other pages.

## Ordering
The order of sections and pages within the menu is determined by the filesystem's
alphabetical ordering. To control this order, each directory and file should be
prefixed with a number (e.g. `01.`). These numerical prefixes are automatically
stripped out during the rendering process, so they do not appear in the menu or URLs.
